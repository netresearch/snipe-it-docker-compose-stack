# compose-file.sh — manage docker compose overlays via COMPOSE_FILE in .env.
#
# Docker compose reads COMPOSE_FILE from .env automatically (Compose v2+)
# and applies the listed files as overlays in order. This script
# idempotently adds / removes paths so `make up` works without manual
# `-f compose.yml -f examples/compose.X.yml` chaining.
#
# Usage:
#   compose-file.sh add    examples/compose.bugsink.yml [more.yml ...]
#   compose-file.sh remove examples/compose.bugsink.yml [more.yml ...]
#   compose-file.sh list
#
# The base `compose.yml` is always implied — if COMPOSE_FILE is unset or
# blank, compose still reads compose.yml + compose.override.yml on its
# own. This script only manages overlays beyond the base.
